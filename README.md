crypt(3) Standard DES password cracker for Ztex 1.15y FPGA board.

FPGA part is ready to go at 700 MH/s, that includes post-encryption processing with a comparator against up to 1K hashes with same salt. There's enough room for further speed improvements.

Host software includes test program written in C. It is planned an integration with some good password cracking tool.
